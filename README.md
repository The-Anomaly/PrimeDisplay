Background
Note

Consider this the canonical resource for contributing Javascript and CSS. We are currently in the process of modernizing our front end development procedures. You will see a lot of different styles around the code base for front end JavaScript and CSS.

Our front end development stack includes the following tools:

HTML,
Javascript,
Typescript,
CSS,
SCSS,
REACT JS

We use the following UI libraries:
Bootstrap,
React-bootstrap.

The front end application currently has some dependecies required for the application to start this are being managed in the package.json file of the application.

### `Getting Started`
You will need a working version of Node (tested with v10.17.0) and NPM to get started. We wonâ€™t cover that here, as it varies from platform to platform.

To install these tools and dependencies:

npm install

This command installs all the front end dependecies registered in the package.json.
